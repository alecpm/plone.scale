Removed deprecated ``factory`` argument from ``scale`` method.
This is in the ``AnnotationStorage`` class and the ``IImageScaleStorage`` interface.
This was already scheduled for removal in ``plone.scale`` 3.0, but was kept longer.
Fixes `issue 47 <https://github.com/plone/plone.scale/issues/47>`_.
