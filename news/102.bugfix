Use "scale" mode as default.
This cleans up more confusion between mode and direction.
See also `plone.namedfile issue 102 <https://github.com/plone/plone.namedfile/issues/102>`_.
Previously our definition of the ``IImageScaleFactory`` interface had the deprecated ``direction="thumbnail"``.
Other parts used ``mode="contain"`` by default, which does cropping, where in Plone we are used to simple scaling almost everywhere.
